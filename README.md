This project is an example of creating a REST API in Node JS using the Express framework.
When developing the project, I used several technologies and divided the development into several stages:
- connected the MySql database and made queries to the database;
- registered routing/router;
- made get/post requests via Postman;
- made user registration and data saving in msql with password encryption via bcryptjs;
- made user authorization using jwt/json web token;
- with the help of Passport JS, I hid routes from unknown users who did not log in and did not receive jwt;
